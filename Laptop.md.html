<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">A laptop is a small, portable personal computer (PC) that typically has a “clamshell” form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard on the inside of the lower lid. They are designed for mobile use, allowing them to be powered by either a rechargeable battery or a continuous wall power supply via an AC adapter.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop">laptop</a> differs from tablet computers in that they usually run on desktop operating systems rather than mobile ones. While they were originally considered a niche market for specialized applications like the military or field sales, they have since become widely used for work, education, gaming, and personal multimedia.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">A <strong>mobile workstation</strong>, also known as a desktop-replacement computer, is a type of laptop that is significantly more powerful and generally more expensive than a standard laptop. These machines are intended for professional use, such as engineering or video editing. Because of their high performance, they often have shorter battery life and require more robust cooling systems compared to thinner models.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">A <strong>gaming laptop</strong> is primarily designed for playing high-end video games. Like mobile workstations, they prioritize power over portability, featuring high refresh rate displays and dedicated graphics cards that support advanced features like ray tracing. They often include specialized hardware like RGB backlit keyboards and advanced thermal management to handle intensive processing loads.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13"><strong>Hybrid laptops</strong>, also known as 2-in-1 PCs, represent a convergence of tablets and laptops. These devices feature touchscreen displays and either a detachable keyboard or a 360-degree hinge that allows the screen to fold back completely. This versatility allows the user to operate the device in “tablet mode” for media consumption or “laptop mode” for traditional productivity tasks.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="17">The basic components of a laptop function identically to their desktop counterparts, but they are miniaturized and adapted for mobile use. Design restrictions regarding power, size, and cooling often limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to desktop components, although this performance gap continues to narrow with technological advancements.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="18" data-line-end="19">Most of the internal hardware is located in the lower part of the chassis under the keyboard. Unlike desktop computers, many laptop components are not intended to be easily replaced or upgraded by the average user, as parts like the processor or memory are often soldered directly onto the motherboard to save space.</p>
